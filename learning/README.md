# OldenborgModel

Train and perform inference on Oldenborg datasets.

## Setup

Create (or update) an environment with the following packages:

~~~bash
conda activate ENVIRONMENT
mamba install pytorch==1.13.1 torchvision==0.14.1 torchaudio==0.13.1 cpuonly -c pytorch
mamba install fastai wandb
~~~

## Architectures

A deeply flawed method for choosing an architecture:

- See [Papers With Code benchmarks](https://paperswithcode.com/task/image-classification)
- Go to the [Hugging Face models listing](https://huggingface.co/models)
- Set the task (eg, "Image Classification")
- Sort by "Trending" and by "Most Downloads"
- Look at model sizes and accuracies
- Set the library (eg, "timm") and search for the model name

`timm` models for these experiments:

| Full Name                                  | Params | Nice Name |
